# Contributions-to-USAID
Items here are public contributions to USAID that I am able to share. Much of my work at USAID is considered private by the US government, and I am unable to share the majority of what I do on a daily basis to a public repository. Please be aware that I was a contributor to most of these projects, and not the sole author. 

* A report that I helped author that tracked the first and second order impacts of covid-19 in USAID supported countries: https://www.usaid.gov/coronavirus/documents/landscape-analysis-tracking-first-and-second-order-impacts-covid-19

* Vaccine Donation Delivery Tableau Dashboard that I helped create to show where the United States and partner countries donated Covid-19 vaccines:

* IDEA is a USAID public website that hosts thousands of indicators related to international development and economics, and also hosts various analytic products relevant to USAID and development. I was a part in regularly maintaining and updating the products hosted on this site:
